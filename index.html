                <h3> iOS App - Vocabular </h3>
                <h4> Swift </h4>
                <h5> Mark Achieved - Pending </h5>
                <p>
                    An iOS app that will help you learn vocabulary in the foreign language of
                    your choice. The app has the following features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>On start-up, it will allow users to define two languages - their own language, and the
                            foreign language they are learning. If this configuration is changed later, then all
                            vocabulary is deleted.</li>

                        <li>The app will allow users to note words they come across in whatever language they
                            are learning, and the meaning of that word in their own language.</li>

                        <li>When a word is noted, the word and its meaning will be added to a vocabulary list,
                            and stored on the device.</li>

                        <li>The user will be able to review their vocabulary list, in an attempt to learn the words
                            they do not know.</li>

                        <li>The user will be able to test themselves on the vocabulary list, and be told how well
                            they have done on the test.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h5> Mark Achieved - Pending </h5>
                <p>
                    A web implementation game that makes use of a Javascript framework called THREE.js. The game that was to be created was a similar gameplay to Angry Birds. This was a final year Assignment.

                <h4> Java </h4>
                <h5> Mark Achieved - 2:1 </h5>
                <p>
                    JoggleCube is a turn-based computer game for one player. The player is given a 3 by 3 by 3 grid of randomly
                    generated letters, and has to compile a list of words of one or more letters that can be generated by moving around
                    the grid one letter at a time either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, without reusing any of the available letters.

                    On this project I was the main programmer.
                    <br>

                <h4> Java </h4>
                <h5> Mark Achieved - 1:1 </h5>
                <p> The assignment required us to implement a block motion animation program where a ‘pixelated dog’ is animated and transformations can be carried out on the animation. This included loading a file which contained the format for the animation. The animation runs on a 20x20 Grid. The animation wraps around the grid, which allows for the transformations to take place, the transformations include flipping the animation vertically and horizontally, and moving left, right, up and down.

                <h5> Mark Achieved - 1:1 </h5>
                <p> The module introduced the core technologies and architectures of the web. In it we covered communications; structure and presentation of content; the client server model; basics of databases for web applications. The assignment was to crate a simple web page on the your own account on the universitys servers.

                    <br><br> Through my A-level studies and into University, I have used Computer Aided Design Software and Computer Aided Manufacture in practical work within workshops. I have also learned the processes required to create databases and websites. I have set up a photography business, which has allowed me to explore my passions and also use my skills in a practical sense. Setting up my own photography business I have used my skills in website design to create a website for my own business and for a local company which is used extensively for and by their customers. I have chosen to carry on my interest and understanding of computer systems alongside my education by perusing a Computer Science degree at Aberystwyth University.
                    <br><br> Through university I have been an active member of the Christian Union and during the academic year 2016/17 I was treasurer on the society's committee. This enabled me to expand my communication and interpersonal skills, show my capability of handling figures, budgets and large sums of money and ensure important decisions surrounding events and changes to the society were made and followed up.
                    <br><br> I was a committed member of Cloughwater Boys’ Brigade from 2000 to 2015. From 2012 – 2016 I completed the President’s, Queen’s and King George VI Leadership Courses – the three most prestigious awards within Boys’ Brigade. By completing these courses, I gained a greater understanding of how to engage and work within a team. I also developed leadership skills and learnt to positively encourage team members to work together and develop the best possible solutions for set tasks.
                    <br><br> Completing Bronze, Silver and Gold Duke of Edinburgh awards provided me with an opportunity to use my leadership and teamwork skills gained from Boys’ Brigade and also develop my determination and confidence, improve my communication skills and I learnt the importance of both motivation, both self and within a team.
                    <br><br> I consider myself to have a high level of technical skill for computing as well as excellent interpersonal skills, which I have developed through extra-curricular programmes. I enjoy the aspect of solving problems and in particular working with others to develop successful solutions.
